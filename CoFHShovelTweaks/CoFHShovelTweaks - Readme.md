# CoFH Shovel Tweaks

This mod is basically my version of [Big Shovel](https://mod.io/g/eco/m/big-shovel) - that's the original and if it does what you need, go get it.

The difference with this one is that each shovel carries different amounts as vanilla and while those amounts are increased, they are not *substantially* larger. It's small QoL without completely subverting the spirit of the Shovel tiering. Amounts are optionally affected by the Global Stacksize Modifier if that is set.

Base progression is as follows:
1,3,5,10 -> 3,5,10,15
