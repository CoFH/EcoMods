# CoFH Eco Mods

So recently I discovered [Eco](https://play.eco/) and gotta say, it's pretty fun. Scratches a Minecraft itch while being distinctly different and also forcing you to collaborate.

It's also moddable.

Nothing here is revolutionary, nor is there any strong need to protect an IP. In most of the sub-readmes, you can see links to other mods that have implemented similar features and I encourage you to use those if these particular modifications aren't your taste.

Also be aware that in their current state, these have been written to all co-exist with each other, and the Farming-Fertilizers Merge mod and Agricultural Science mods specifically alter professions in such a way that you'll need to adjust some of the the other mods (by either commenting or uncommenting sections) if you aren't using both of them. This applies to:

- CoFHRecycling (`ReclaimModernUpgrade.cs`)
- CoFHScrollsNotBooks (`ScrollCopying.cs`, `ScrollsNotBooks.cs`)

Just look for the `#region MODDED` blocks as well as the large portions of commented code. Adjust as necessary.

Other than that, see the attached license file for permissions/reuse. (It's MIT).

Wait, why MIT when Minecraft mods are ARR? Well, this community hasn't wished harm upon me or my family yet nor have they actively attempted to steal anything from me and claim it as their own.

Have fun.
