# CoFH XP Tweaks

This mod does some basic adjustment around XP.

By default, it grants new users experience as if they had been created when the server initially started. So somebody joining a couple weeks in will probably get an extra star or two.

It also allows you to configure extra stars (which count as levels and increase XP for next star) and bonus stars (which do not).
