# CoFH Cooking Flexibility

This mod does exactly what it says - provides some flexibility in workstation choice.

All Cooking recipes have been added to the Kitchen and Stove, as appropriate. Salads are made in the Kitchen, meals on the Stove. The Cooking Upgrade is now a valid module for these workstations.

This means that you have the option of replacing a Cast Iron Stove should you choose to (though be aware of the Upgrade Module tradeoff).

## Installation Instructions:
