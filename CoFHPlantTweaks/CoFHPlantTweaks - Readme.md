# CoFH Plant Tweaks

This is a super simple mod which enables regrowth on the following plants, meaning they do not need to be replanted:

- Beans
- Clams
- Kelp
- Urchin

Beans have been modified to work as other terrestrial plants which regrow on their own:

- 1.2 Day Maturity (+0.4)
- 0.5 Post-Harvest Percentage
- 0.8 Minimum Harvest Percentage

Clams, Kelp, and Urchin all have the following adjustments:

- 0.05 Post-Harvest Percentage
- 0.8 Minimum Harvest Percentage
