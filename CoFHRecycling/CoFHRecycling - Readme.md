# CoFH Recycling

This is a simple mod which adds a number of "Recycling" recipes to the game to remove outdated and unwanted tools, furniture, and vehicles.

Generally, the amount of material returned is 1/4 of the amount used in the creation recipe, rounded down. This ensures that there is no potential resource gain. Additionally, no experience is granted for these recipes.

Many wooden items, such as early game furniture and canoes, have been given Fuel values and can simply be burned.
