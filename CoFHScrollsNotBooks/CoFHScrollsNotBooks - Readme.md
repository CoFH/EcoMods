# CoFH Scrolls Not Books

This mod does two things:

- Converts Skill Book recipes into Skill Scroll recipes. This is 100% reused from [No More Books](https://mod.io/g/eco/m/no-more-books) and the only reason I have copied that mod in its entirety is to have an edited version which matches the skill changes that we use (Farming/Fertilizers Merge, Agricultural Science Skill). Full credit to MonzUn for the original which is perfect in its simplicity.

If you are not playing with those skill changing mods, you should get the original version of the mod.

- Adds a Scroll Copying recipe (it's a multi-recipe) for Paper Millers. This allows them to be a skill library if they so choose. Input quantities for Paper and Paint can be trivially adjusted using the settings class.
